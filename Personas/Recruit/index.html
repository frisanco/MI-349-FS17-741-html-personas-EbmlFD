      <p> Prospective Recruit </p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
      <h1> Quote </h1>
      <p> "I'm dedicated to providing a healthy work environment for myself, as well as my coworkers." </p>
      <p> "My past collaborative job experiences have given me a better understanding of what it means to be a team player." </p>

      <p> Age 25; Courteous and professional; seeks employment in the aeronautics industry. </p>
      <p> (Possible) Title: Engineering Analyst; works with team, as well as independently, on product engineering and analysis projects. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="goals">
      <h1> What Goals? </h1>
      <p> Montana seeks opportunity. He seeks to better himself every day, along with those around him. </p>
      <p> In return Montana demands respect, hard work, and CONSTANT communication in regards both to successes and failures. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="attitude">
      <h1> What Attitude? </h1>
      <p> Montana expects professionalism, but has been known to act childishly when around certain crowds and under pressure. </p>
      <p> Information accessed by Montana should be easy to understand, but not too bland, as details are likely to be ignored. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="behavior">
      <h1> Which Behavior? </h1>
      <p> Montana often wastes time when performing research on websites, looking for interesting ways to avoid work. </p>
      <p> That being said, if a site offers information in an easily-presentable way, Montana locates details and performs tasks fairly quickly. </p>

      <h4><strong> Trends </strong></h4>
      <p> Bland and structured websites do not interest Montana. He hopes that the next website he visits will spark his childish interests. </p>

      <h4><strong> Functional Importance </strong></h4>
      <p> Montana works off of emotion, and his body language shows it. Functionality is still important, but the format of the page is often the determining factor in his productivity. </p>

      <h4><strong> Decision Making </strong></h4>
      <p> Decisions are made quickly. His childish tendencies under pressure cause him to jump to conclusions. Therefore, the main page of the site MUST spark his interest. </p>

      <h4><strong> Facts or Emotion? </strong></h4>
      <p> Montana bases his decisions purely on emotion, and so follows his work ethic. </p>
      <p> He does work very well when he is willing and interested on a particular topic, but quickly declines if motivation does not present itself. </p>
