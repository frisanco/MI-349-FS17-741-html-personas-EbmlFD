    <div class="descriptor">
      <h1> Descriptor </h1>
      <p> Current Earth Beyond Employee </p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
      <h1> Quote </h1>
      <p> "My team is currently working with contractors on these rocket booster blueprints." </p>
      <p> "Would it be possible to take a two week vacation? I am, after all, a 5 year veteran." </p>
    </div>

    <div class="who">
      <h1> Who is it? </h1>
      <p> Age 32; Helpful, kind, but hard-working in every sense of the term; wants success for herself, as well as Earth Beyond. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="goals">
      <h1> What Goals? </h1>
      <p> Personal achievement. Megan has worked hard to obtain the position she currently holds; productivity and personal goal setting are huge parts of her work ethic. </p>
      <p> Megan works positively and is always willing to learn. Sites and shops should be easy to understand, but she's willing to learn and improve processes when necessary. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="attitude">
      <h1> What Attitude? </h1>
      <p> Similar to Gary, she expects professionalism, courtesy, but also some leeway in regard to strictness. </p>
      <p> Being close to her team, she often finds herself cross-referencing her colleagues findings on the web. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="behavior">
      <h1> Which Behavior? </h1>
      <p> Clear organization and communication are a MUST. Information must be able to be accessed quickly in order to keep a full flow of communication between her and her colleagues. </p>
      <p> Frustrations arise when processes show promise, but are not improved. Megan wants to see the best for her team, but her time is limited. </p>

      <h4><strong> Trends </strong></h4>
      <p> Retro and mainstream websites catch Megan's eye. Unlike those in higher management positions who seek perfection, she is willing to accept less. </p>

      <h4><strong> Functional Importance </strong></h4>
      <p> Functionality is a HUGE plus to Megan, as well as her team, as every person should not have to worry about frustrations when accessing shared information. </p>

      <h4><strong> Decision Making </strong></h4>
      <p> Megan often takes time to evaluate a decision. Her time is important, but the success of her team is even more important. </p>

      <h4><strong> Facts or Emotion? </strong></h4>
      <p> More decisions are based on emotion. The "language" of the team often influences Megan's decisions in future conflicts. </p>
